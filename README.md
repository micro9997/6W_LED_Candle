# Development of 6W LED Candle (Full-Featured Cost-effective Design)

## Introduction:
In 2022, during Sri Lanka's economic crisis characterized by frequent power outages, the need for affordable, reliable backup lighting became crucial. In response to this challenge, I developed the 6W LED Candle, a cost-effective solution designed to provide consistent illumination for over four hours on a single charge.

## Project Brief:
The 6W LED Candle is a compact backup light tailored to meet the specific needs of lower and middle-class individuals in Sri Lanka. Key features include:
- 4+ hours of constant brightness on a single charge.
- Touch switch for convenient on/off functionality.
- Compatibility with mobile chargers (micro-B) for easy recharging.
- Utilization of surface-mount technology (SMT) components for efficiency and compactness.

## Technologies Used:
- TP4056 Lithium-ion Charger
- DW01A Battery Management System (BMS)
- MT3608 LED driver
- TTP223 touch switch
- Schematic & PCB Designing (Using Autodesk Fusion 360), with PCB production by JLCPCB.

## Key Challenges & Learning:
Designing the 6W LED Candle posed several challenges, including:
- Ensuring cost-effectiveness without compromising reliability.
- Maintaining consistent brightness for extended periods.
- Integrating mobile charger compatibility to reduce overall product cost.
